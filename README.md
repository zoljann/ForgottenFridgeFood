# ForgottenFridgeFood: React Native App

ForgottenFridgeFood is my very first project. I built this app from the beginning to learn new technologies and dive into mobile development. I've used React Native, a popular JavaScript library.

### About app

We understand it's challenging to keep track of your fridge essentials and consume them before they expire. Therefore, we offer a simple solution that requires a weekly time commitment. The main aim of this application is to reduce food waste by tracking your fridge contents and sending you notifications when food is approaching its expiration date. For instance, while shopping, you can use the app to check your fridge's content and identify missing or expiring items. In addition, there's a Shopping screen for easily creating shopping lists, eliminating the need for paper or mobile notes. The Impact screen provides insights into the application's impact, including the number of users, food saved, and more.
