# ForgottenFridgeFood: React Native App

ForgottenFridgeFood is our first project ever, we have build this application from **scratch**. We wanted to try new technologies and learn more about mobile development, so we use one of the most popular javascript library - React Native.

### About app

We know that is hard for you to track all your fridge essentials and and consume it before the expiration date, so we are offering you a simple solution for which you will still need to set aside some time on weekly basis. Primary goal of this application is to reduce food waste, it will track all of your fridge food and send you notification whenever food deadline is. Also, for some real example if you're in supermarket buying yourself food, you can run this application and see content of your fridge and just like that you will know what food you are missing out and what food are going to expire. Aside from all of that you have *Shopping screen* where u can write your shopping lists easily, so put that paper and pen to side and close mobile notes this time. Last screen is *Impact screen* where you can see how much impact will made this application, how many users using it, how much food we saved and etc.

#### Technologies
